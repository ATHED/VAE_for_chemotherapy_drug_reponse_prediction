# VAE_for_chemotherapy_drug_reponse_prediction

This a program in progress. The idea is using variational auto-encoder to extract lower dimension abstract data from gene expression data. Then applying those lower dimension abstract data to predict chemotherapy response on various type of cancers.

A preprint based on this research will be released soon.

You can create the virtual environment contains all necessory packages from the enviroment file provided, and with code:
```
conda env create -f tensorflow-gpu-environment-stable.yml

```

You need to install Cuda, and Cudnn on you workstation first.
